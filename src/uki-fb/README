VERSION INFO

early   Might not even work. Probably untested or tested once in
draft   a particular condition. May server as placeholder for later
        implementation. BEWARE!

draft   Both API and code are VERY unstable. Likely to be changed
        considerably or removed/replaced. Use at you're own risk.
        Redundant code, especially CSS, may be present. Should
        work at least on latest webkit/gecko browsers in a particular
        scenario.

alpha   API is mostly stable. Code is relatively untested.
        Small changes to public API are possible though unlikely.
        Code and protected API is likely to change.
        Should work at least on latest webkit/gecko browsers.

1.0     API is fixed within 1.* range. Methods may be added but
        not changed or removed. Protected API is unlikely to change.
        Should work on latest webkit, gecko, trident, opera browsers.
